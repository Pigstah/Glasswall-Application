Please find all the documents required to apply for the DevOps Engineer role.

I'm excited to share this with you and would love to receive any feedback regarding the work. I think using this approuch is a lot better than your standard interviews and gives you a good idea of how a persons mind works and if they are going to be a good fit.

If you have any questions or issues with this repo, please let me know and I'll be more than happy to help.
